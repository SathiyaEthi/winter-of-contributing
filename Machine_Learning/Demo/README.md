This folder contains the demo file namings of all the three categories. It's only for the demo purpose, nothing else.

### **Documentation**

File name : `ML_<serial number>_<name of the issue>_(type of contribution).md` or `.ipynb`

Example : `ML_1_2_PDFs and CDFs_(D).md`

**_Both markdown file and ipynb file are accepted!_**

*************************************

### **Audio and Video**
In both cases we need a thumbnail, which will be hyperlinked with the Google drive link you have.

File name : `ML_<serial number>_<name of the issue>_(A/V).md` [A for Audio and V for Video]

Example Audio file name : `ML_1_2_PDFs and CDFs_(A).md`

Example Video file name : `ML_1_2_PDFs and CDFs_(V).md`

Inside the markdown file you have to attach the thumbnail and then hyperlink the thumbnail with the link of your file. For the thumbnail, upload the image in the `Assets` folder, and take the URL of the image from their to add the thumbnail in the markdown file. 

Now let me show you the syntax, as you guys can see that I have uploaded an image in the demo folder, (for you guys, you will be uploading your images in the `Assets` folder), now I have taken the image link from the `Demo folder` as, `https://github.com/girlscript/winter-of-contributing/blob/Machine_Learning/Machine_Learning/Demo/download.png`. 

This is our thumbnail, now I've taken a video from Youtube, `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwglfLv5otA`. (Here you'll be using your contribution file link)

Now come to the syntax, `[![Your_Title](Image_link_for_Video_thumbnail)](Your_video_link "Your_title")`
For the above thumbnail and video link that I've chosen it'll be, `[![GirlScript QNA YouTube Video](https://github.com/girlscript/winter-of-contributing/blob/Machine_Learning/Machine_Learning/Demo/download.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwglfLv5otA)`

This will be looking like this,

[![GirlScript QNA YouTube Video](https://github.com/girlscript/winter-of-contributing/blob/Machine_Learning/Machine_Learning/Demo/download.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwglfLv5otA)

Once you hover around the thumbnail, you'll be getting the link hovering around in the bottom left corner of your screen!

Simply, you guys have to, create the markdown file, name that properly, upload your thumbnail in the `Assets` folder, then write the code as per the syntax `[![Your_Title](Image_link_for_Video_thumbnail)](Your_video_link "Your_title")`, and that's it!
