    "# Confusion Matrix\n",
    "In the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification, a confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix.\n",
    "A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or “classifier”) on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows the visualization of the performance of an algorithm.\n",
    "It allows easy identification of confusion between classes e.g. one class is commonly mislabeled as the other. Most performance measures are computed from the confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gives us insight not only into the errors being made by a classifier but more importantly the types of errors that are being made.\n",

    "Since we have two measures (Precision and Recall) it helps to have a measurement that represents both of them. We calculate an F-measure which uses Harmonic Mean in place of Arithmetic Mean as it punishes the extreme values more.\n",
